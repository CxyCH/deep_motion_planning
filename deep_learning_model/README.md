# deep_learning_model

Learn how to navigate in urban environments with deep learning

## Usage
### Data Generation
Run:
```
make data
```
to take the single .csv files and generate a single HDF5 container with the entire data. Please
refer to the Makefile to change the files and folders that are used for the data preparation.

### Train a Model
```
make train
```
This will start the training of your model. Please refer to the Makefile to change the files and folders
that are used during training. Furthermore, we set some metaparameters (initial learning rate,
maximum number of steps and the batch size) in this file.

### Tensorboard

```
make tensorboard
```
This will start Googles Tensorboard with the ./models/default folder as log directory.
